# Evidence-based Line Segment Merging

ELSM is a technique that takes detected segments for an image and its size as input and results in merged segments. It overcomes the weaknesses of existing detection algorithms that result in broken segments. The links will allow you to download the paper [paper](/assets/ELSMpdf.pdf) and code [code](/assets/ELSMcode.zip). Here, we provide a step-by-step generic approach for the technique as an image.
